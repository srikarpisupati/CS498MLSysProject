# Configuration for ML Compiler Benchmark

benchmark:
  warmup_iterations: 10      # Iterations to skip (GPU warmup, JIT compilation)
  measured_iterations: 100   # Iterations to measure and report

models:
  # - name: resnet50
  #   input_shape: [3, 224, 224]
  #   batch_sizes: [1, 32]
  #   precision: fp32
  - name: mobilenet_v3
    input_shape: [3, 224, 224]
    batch_sizes: [1, 32]
    precision: fp32

compilers:
  # - pytorch_eager      # Baseline (no compilation)
  # - torchscript        # TorchScript JIT compiler
  # - onnxruntime        # ONNX Runtime (CUDA EP)
  - tvm                # TVM Relay / graph executor (needs TVM installed)
