# Configuration for ML Compiler Benchmark

benchmark:
  warmup_iterations: 10      # Iterations to skip (GPU warmup, JIT compilation)
  measured_iterations: 100   # Iterations to measure and report

model:
  name: resnet50
  input_shape: [3, 224, 224]  # ImageNet standard (C, H, W)
  batch_sizes: [1, 32]        # Single image vs batched
  precision: fp32             # fp32, fp16, or int8

compilers:
  - pytorch_eager      # Baseline (no compilation)
  - torchscript        # TorchScript JIT compiler (works on P100!)
  - tvm                # TVM Relay / graph executor (needs TVM installed)

output:
